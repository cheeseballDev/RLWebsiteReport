                <p>In religion, conversion refers to the process of adopting a new religious belief, faith, or set of practices. 
                    <li>
                        This can occur either through a personal decision to change one's religious identity or through social or cultural influence.

                    <li>
                        Conversion may involve formally joining a different religious group, renouncing one's previous beliefs, or undergoing a spiritual transformation.

                    <li>

                    By translating Catholic doctrine into native languages, the Spanish made Christianity more accessible to Filipinos.

                    <p>During the 16th and 17th century, the Spanish colonial government implemented a system called reducción in the Philippines, which involved consolidating scattered rural populations into centralized towns or villages. This was intended to make governance and religious conversion easier for the Spanish authorities. Each reducción town was organized around a central plaza where a church and government buildings were constructed, following the Spanish model of town planning. This structure allowed Spanish friars to more effectively carry out their missionary work, providing regular religious instruction and fostering a strong Catholic presence.</p>

                <p> The demand of conversion and confession is related to Rizal Life and Works because it affected the events of the cavite mutiny. Due to the Christianity or its influence, it made Filipinos have the privilege to become priests, thus becoming educated. The schools and universities built back then like the University of Santo Thomas (as previously mentioned by another member), its purpose is to spread religion which directly influenced Rizal himself.</p>
